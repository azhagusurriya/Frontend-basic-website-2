                    <p>
                        On April 7, 2010, Cousins announced that he would forgo his final three seasons of collegiate eligibility and enter the 2010 NBA draft, where he was selected by the Sacramento Kings with the fifth overall pick. On July 7, 2010, Cousins signed his rookie

                    <h3>2011–12 season</h3>
                    <p>
                        On January 1, 2012, head coach Paul Westphal sent Cousins home from the Kings' home game against the New Orleans Hornets, saying that Cousins was "unwilling/unable to embrace traveling in the same direction as his team; it cannot be ignored indefinitely."
                        Cousins, who had been averaging 13.0 points and 11.3 rebounds per game at the time of the dismissal, reportedly demanded to be traded from the Kings. Cousins later denied asking to be traded. On January 5, 2012, Westphal was fired
                        from the Kings, leading many to speculate that the head coach's tumultuous relationship with Cousins was a factor in his being replaced.On February 8, 2012, Cousins was selected to play in the Rising Stars Challenge. He played
                        for Team Chuck, with a mix of rookies and sophomores.
