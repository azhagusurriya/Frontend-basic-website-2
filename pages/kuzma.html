                        met his father only once as an infant, but viewed the father of his half-siblings, Larry Smith, as a father figure.Karri Kuzma and Smith put a toy basketball rim in the living room for Kyle when he was only two years old, thus
                        igniting his passion for basketball.Kuzma has described Flint as "'a really violent place [where] there's a lot of temptation to get into the streets.'" However, Kuzma described basketball as his "'safe haven'". Kuzma attended
                        Swartz Creek Community Schools and transferred to Bentley High School in Michigan, where he averaged 17.9 points, 14.4 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 3.4 blocks per game as a junior.Kuzma sent tapes of his shooting at the YMCA to preparatory
                        schools; Vin Sparacio, head coach at Rise Academy in Philadelphia, "saw a 6'6", 175-pound, raw player who had a great feel for the game, and immediately brought him in." As a high school senior at Rise Academy, Kuzma averaged 22
                        points and seven rebounds per game.Kuzma received offers to play with Division I schools including Connecticut, Iowa State, Tennessee, and Missouri, among others, before deciding on the University of Utah.
